Notes
-----

The plugin is in pre-beta state, use with care at your own risk ;)
It should not break something, but don't blame at me if not everything goes well.
I know the code looks ugly on some places... just hacked it together and it works for me, but I'll give my best to clean it up as soon as possible.
Feel free to submit bugs you've found or feature requests!
